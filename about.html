	<p>Through creative prompts participants  are invited to surprise themselves with  the ideas and instincts that emerge from  their deepest selves. It takes an open framework to what choreography can be and encourages participants to explore individual perspectives inclusive of any and all interests and backgrounds. Each class will stem from a cluster of prompts around a theme. Prompts are designed to challenge and be specific but open to interpretation. By sharing work and having generous, rigorous conversations we aim to dive deeper and deeper into flow state.</p>

	<h2>Conduct</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>This is a safe space of exploration and invention.</li>

		<li>Kindness, respect, generosity and support are the bedrock of this workshop, any language or actions that do not reflect these values is not tolerated. </li>

		<li>Mistakes however are human and when they occur it is crucial that they are resolved and used as moments to grow and learn. One way of attending to these moments is “ouch” “oops” strategy in which the hurt is explained and there is an opportunity for an apology. If more support is needed please reach out to me and an arrangement to resolve the concern will be made. </li>
