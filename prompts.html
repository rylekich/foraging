			<h3>Self as source OR the endless well of content within</h3>
			<p>When I think about self as source I’m curious about what our creative brains are working on when all the debris and constraints of trying to assimilate into the world around us are removed. What would we invent if we had nothing in the way? I believe that there is some magical part of us generating content whether we are bringing it to life or not and that it is an endless well continually renewing, having non-verbal conversations with itself and once in a while we have access to the fun. </p>
